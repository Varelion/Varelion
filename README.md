I'm a passionate software developer with a focus on creating innovative solutions. One of my notable projects is the "**Scandroid 「MIRAGE」"** Application, which I developed, deployed, and maintain. This application has hundreds of daily users and is designed to provide a seamless experience for any TTRPG play-by-post, but presently it's mainly geared at 5e; this will change in the future, as the application is being entirely restructured and rebuilt into C#.

In addition to my work on the "Scandroid 「MIRAGE」" Application, I have experience with development of automated tools for OSINT gathering, as well as AI-assisted, orchestrated data compilation—not exactly RAG LLMs, but also RAG LLMs. These skills allow me to efficiently gather and analyze data from various sources, providing valuable insights and actionable information.

I'm also actively involved in job searching, leveraging my technical expertise and problem-solving abilities to identify opportunities that align with my professional goals and interests.
